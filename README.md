# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City using various trip attributes as predictors. The dataset used for this project is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data that was made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The dataset includes variables such as pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. The model will be built using Python and machine learning techniques. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, and the model will be optimized to achieve the best possible prediction accuracy.
